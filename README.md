# Asteroid Cloud Simulation

This repository contains a simple simulation of an asteroid cloud orbiting around a center point, represented as a "cloud" on the canvas. The simulation uses the p5.js library to handle graphics and animation.

## How to Run

To run the simulation, you will need a local development environment set up with Node.js. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/asteroid-cloud-simulation.git`.
2. Navigate to the project folder using `cd asteroid-cloud-simulation`.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the local server by running `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the simulation.

The simulation displays a cloud of asteroids orbiting around a center point, with each asteroid experiencing attraction and repulsion forces that create an interesting visual effect.

## Configuration

The simulation can be customized using a JSON configuration file. The configuration file (`config.json`) allows you to tweak various parameters, such as the size of the cloud, attraction and repulsion strengths, maximum speed, and more. Feel free to experiment with these values to create different patterns and visual effects.

## Controls

- Left-click and drag to move the cloud center and observe how the asteroids interact with it.
- The cloud name is displayed above the cloud center.

## Planet and Craters

In addition to the asteroid cloud, the simulation includes a planet-like dot at the cloud's center. The color of the dot is randomly generated, and static craters are placed around the cloud center. The planet-like dot rotates at a configured speed.

## Issues

If you encounter any issues while running the simulation or have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to create an issue in this repository. Your feedback is valuable and will help us enhance the simulation further.

## Acknowledgments

The asteroid cloud simulation is built using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding and visualization.
